# Description 
For any scientific research, traceability is crucial. To achieve this aim, MRI is attempting to improve data-management procedures in order to obtain, at the final stage, a proper and full data/metadata annotation that provides a decent review process and grants reproducibility. This method frames data effectively, allowing for knowledge reuse, researcher's work credit, and the safeguarding of precious resources.
