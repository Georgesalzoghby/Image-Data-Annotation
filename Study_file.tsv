Study Description	 The genome folds into a hierarchy of three-dimensional structures within the nucleus.
                         At the sub-megabase scale, chromosomes form topologically associating domains (TADs). 
                         However, how TADs fold in single cells is elusive. Here, we reveal TAD features inaccessible to cell population 
			 analysis by using super-resolution microscopy.
			 TAD structures and physical insulation associated with their borders are variable between individual cells, 
			 yet chromatin intermingling is enriched within TADs compared to adjacent TADs in most cells.
                         The spatial segregation of TADs is further exacerbated during cell differentiation.
			 Favored interactions within TADs are regulated by cohesin and CTCF through distinct mechanisms:
			 cohesin generates chromatin contacts and intermingling while CTCF prevents inter-TAD contacts. 
			 Furthermore, TADs are subdivided into discrete nanodomains, which persist in cells depleted of CTCF or cohesin, 
			 whereas disruption of nucleosome contacts alters their structural organization. 
                         Altogether, these results provide a physical basis for the folding of individual chromosomes at the nanoscale.

Assay Experimental Conditions	Mouse ESCs of Experiment A were differentiated into NPCs as described by Gaspard et al. (doi: 10.1038/nprot.2009.157) with the following changes. Cells were plated (2.5 × 105 cells per 10-cm dish) on 0.1% gelatin-coated dishes in the ESC medium described in Experiment A. After 1 d, cells were cultured in DDM medium (DMEM/F-12, GlutaMAX supplement; catalog no. 31331028; Gibco), supplemented with 0.05% bovine albumin fraction (catalog no. 15260037; Gibco), 1× MEM non-essential amino acids, 50 U penicillin-streptomycin, 1× N-2 supplement (catalog no. 17502048; Gibco), 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. From day 2 to day 10, medium was changed every 2 d and cyclopamine V. californicum (catalog no. 239803; Merck Millipore) was added to the medium (final concentration of 0.4 μg ml−1). After 12 d of differentiation, cells were dissociated with StemPro Accutase (catalog no. A1110501; Gibco), plated on 6-well plates coated with poly-L-lysine (catalog no. P2636; Sigma-Aldrich)/laminin (catalog no. 11243217001; Sigma-Aldrich) and cultured in a 1:1 mixture of DDM and neurobasal medium (catalog no. 21103049; Gibco) supplemented with 1× B-27 supplement minus vitamin A (catalog no. 12587010; Gibco) and 1× GlutaMAX supplement and 50 U penicillin-streptomycin for an additional 2 d (day 12 + 2) to obtain NPCs.

Assay Experimental Conditions	Mouse brains from E14.5 C57BL/6J embryos were dissected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight at 4 °C. They were then cryopreserved for 24 h at 4 °C in a PBS-20% sucrose solution. After embedding in optimal cutting temperature compound and rapid freezing in isopentane, brains were sectioned at 10-μm width on slides with a cryostat (Leica Biosystems).

Assay Experimental Conditions	Mouse CTCF-AID ES cells (ID no. EN204.3; doi: 10.1016/j.molcel.2019.08.015) were cultured in the same condition as in Experiment A. The induction of CTCF degradation by the Auxin-inducible degron (AID) system (referred to as AUX) was performed as described in Nora et al. (doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2017.05.004). Briefly, indole-3-acetic acid sodium salt (auxin analog; catalog no. 16954; Cayman Chemical) was added to the medium (final concentration at 500 µM) for 2 d before collecting cells. Control condition of Experiment D was performed with the same cells and in the same conditions, but without the auxin treatment.

For the induction of RAD21 degradation by the Auxin-inducible degron (AID) system (referred to as AUX), indole-3-acetic acid sodium salt (auxin analog; catalog no. 16954; Cayman Chemical) was added to the medium (final concentration at 500 μM) for 6 h before collecting cells. Control condition of Experiment F was performed with the same cells and in the same conditions, but without the auxin treatment.

Assay Experimental Conditions	Flies (Drosophila melanogaster) were raised in standard cornmeal yeast extract medium at 21 °C. Embryos were collected on agar/vinegar plates at stages 15–16 after egg laying, equivalent to a development of 12–16 h at 25 °C. Embryos were manually dechorionated on a double-sided adhesive tape and displayed on an agar/vinegar plate to avoid drying during manual selection under a GFP binocular. A Y-GFP reporter line (y[1], w[67c23];Dp(1;Y), y[+] P{ry+11} P{w[+mC]=ActGFP}JMR1) was used to select WT GFP+ male embryos (Szabo et al., doi: 10.1126/sciadv.aar8082). The reason of using this particular Drosophila line is explained in Experiment L.

Assay Experimental Conditions	Flies (Drosophila melanogaster) were raised and embryos were processes as in Experiment K. To analyze the 110 kb Drosophila TAD in an haploid context, that is, on chromosome X in male embryos, a Y-GFP reporter line (y[1], w[67c23];Dp(1;Y), y[+] P{ry+11} P{w[+mC]=ActGFP}JMR1) was used to select WT GFP+ male embryos (Szabo et al., doi: 10.1126/sciadv.aar8082). For the sake of homogeneity and simplicity, the same Drosophila line was used in Experiment K.
